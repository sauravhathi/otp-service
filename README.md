# OTP Service

The OTP (One-Time Password) Free Service is a Node.js-based service that allows you to generate and verify one-time passwords (OTP) via email. This service is useful for adding an extra layer of security to your applications by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) or passwordless login.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

| Prerequisite          | Description                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js and npm       | Install Node.js and npm on your development machine.            |
| MongoDB database     | Set up a MongoDB database (local or cloud-hosted, e.g., MongoDB Atlas) for storing OTP data. |

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/sauravhathi/otp-service.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd otp-service
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project root directory. You can use the provided `.env.example` as a template.

5. Start the service:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

The service should now be running on the specified port (default is 3000).

## Usage

### Generating an OTP

To generate an OTP for a user, make a POST request to the `/api/otp/generate` endpoint with the user's email address in the request body. You can also specify the OTP type, organization name, and email subject.

Example request:

```json
POST /api/otp/generate
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "type": "numeric",
  "organization": "MyApp",
  "subject": "OTP Verification"
}
```

The service will send an email containing the OTP to the user's email address.

### Verifying an OTP

To verify an OTP for user authentication, make a POST request to the `/api/otp/verify` endpoint with the user's email address and the OTP in the request body.

Example request:

```json
POST /api/otp/verify
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "otp": "123456"
}
```

The service will respond with a success message if the OTP is valid.

## Configuration

You can customize the OTP service by modifying the environment variables in the `.env` file. Here are some key configuration options:

## Scheduled OTP Cleanup

The service automatically clears expired OTPs based on the configured cron schedule. By default, it runs daily at midnight to remove expired OTPs.

## Spam Detection

The service uses a spam detection mechanism to prevent abuse. It checks the request body for spam keywords and blocks the request if any are found. You can configure the spam keywords by setting the `SPAM_WORDS` environment variable.
